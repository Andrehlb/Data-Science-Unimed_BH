In the Unimed-BH Data Science I am working with educational experiences with Python, relational and non-relational databases, as well as an immersion in Cloud Computer and Machine Learning.
In this repository shows:
  * Loops
  * Data types
  * MySQL-WorkBench: Logic and Physic models
  * Others 
  
ThatÂ´s all!
